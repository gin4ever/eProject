                        Dog vaccinations will help your dog to be protected against some of the most common and most
                        dangerous infectious diseases. For young dogs especially, it is critical to get the right
                        vaccinations according to the puppy vaccination schedule to help build up their immunity.

                            Dog and puppy vaccinations are basically a training camp for your dog’s immune system. The
                            white blood cells in his body will produce proteins (so called antibodies) that will,
                            together with other white blood cells, fight the infectious agent (called antigens). It is
                            recommended to top up your dog’s vaccinations frequently to make sure his body still has
                            enough of the trained antibodies to be able to fight the infectious germs when needed.

                            The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) splits recommended dog vaccinations into “core”
                            and “non-core” vaccines.

                            Over the last decade there has been increasing debate about the over-vaccination of pets.
                            Depending on the vaccine used and the individual animal, immunity can last significantly
                            longer than 12 months. Some pet owners worry about vaccinating their pet whilst its
                            immunisation is still sufficient.

                        <p id="answer10">
                            What you feed your puppy now has a direct effect on his future health, growth and
                            development, so it's not surprising that I get asked a LOT of questions about diet and puppy
                            food.
                            <br>
                            Choose puppy kibble that has the wording 'a complete and balanced diet' on the package. This
                            shows it meets the standards set by the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control
                            Officials).
                            <br>
                            You need to be sure the dog food you pick has a good source of high quality protein as it's
                            first ingredient. Chicken or Lamb are both good choices.
                            <br>
                            Puppies grow very rapidly, and to support that growth they need a diet high in protein, fat,
                            vitamins and minerals.
                            <br>
                            Protein values should be around 25% plus and fat around 15%. If you have a large breed or
                            small breed puppy, look for a puppy food that is especially designed to meet their specific
                            requirements.
                            <br>

                            How Can I Get Rid Of Dog Urine Stains & Odor?</button>
                        <p id="answer11">
                            Even when potty training is going smoothly, there will be times when your puppy has an
                            'accident'. It's one of those 'puppy FAQs of life'.
                            <br>
                            To avoid having your carpets ruined you need to act quickly, and tackle those puddles in the
                            right way.
                            <br>
                            To be effective, you need to blot up any liquid that is in your carpet. Then you need to
                            rinse the area well with clean, cool water and blot that up too.
                            <br>
                            Follow this with an application of an enzymatic-based cleaner/odor remover. Allow this to
                            soak into the carpet for at least 10 minutes and then blot up the excess. Allow area to dry
                            thoroughly.
                            <br>
                            You may need to repeat this process more than once.
                            <br>

                            Does My Puppy Have Worms & How Do I Treat Them?</button>
                        <p id="answer12">
                            A huge percentage of puppies have worms and if you're a new puppy parent, it's something you
                            may well have to deal with.
                            <br>
                            Some worms can be seen in your dog's feces, and in severe cases of roundworm infestation
                            your pup may even have worms in his vomit. Other symptoms of worm infestation include a
                            round, distended belly, a dull, rough coat or a cough.
                            <br>
                            Although very common, worms can make your puppy quite sick...at the very least he'll feel
                            and look 'out of sorts'.
                            <br>
                            You will need your veterinarian to diagnose and confirm the infestation, and the type of
                            worm involved. They will then prescribe, or administer, the appropriate de-wormer. Do not
                            use over-the-counter medications as they can be ineffective at best, and harmful at worst.
                            <br>
                            Heartworms are a different story, but you are unlikely to find these in a young puppy.

                            This is one of those questions where it's not necessarily easy to figure out the answer
                            without veterinary help.
                            <br>
                            Diarrhea in puppies is very common and can be a sign of a simple tummy upset due to a change
                            in diet for example - or a deadly serious illness such as Parvo.
                            <br>
                            If your puppy has diarrhea that looks has the consistency of chocolate pudding, but
                            otherwise seems okay, chances are he's eaten something he shouldn't.
                            <br>
                            If he's not vomiting, is alert, playful and bright-eyed you can probably afford to wait and
                            see for a while. BUT if he's not feeling better within 24 hours, or seems to be getting
                            worse, call your veterinarian right away.
                            <br>
                            If your puppy's diarrhea is severe and watery, he's vomiting and/or seems lethargic, has
                            dull eyes and looks like he feel unwell you need to get in touch with your veterinarian
                            right away.
                            <br>
                            If it's after hours you should contact your nearest 24 hour emergency pet clinic. This could
                            be a life-or-death situation.

                        <p id="answer15">
                            If you want your precious little puppy to grow up to be a well-behaved companion, you need
                            to teach him or her some manners, and some basic obedience commands.
                            <br>
                            A fair number of puppy FAQs center around puppy behavior, and learning what behavior is
                            acceptable and what isn't should be some of his earliest lessons!
                            <br>
                            If you want your pup to understand what you expect of him, there are three simple steps that
                            you MUST follow :
                            tell your puppy what you want him to do
                            <br>
                            help him to perform that behavior
                            <br>
                            reward him with treats and/or praise when he is successful
                            Several short training sessions per day are much better than one longer one because you want
                            him to enjoy his trainings sessions and think they're a fun part of his day.
                            <br>
                            The first thing to teach your little one is to recognize his name. After that, the basic
                            obedience commands that you want your pup to teach him are "sit", "come" and "down". You can

                            How Do I Introduce My New Puppy To The Resident Dog?</button>
                        <p id="answer16">
                            Most dogs learn to get along with a newcomer (and some super-sociable souls accept them
                            right away), but if your older dog is treating the new baby with something less than
                            unbridled enthusiasm he won't be the first to do so!
                            <br>
                            When choosing a new dog to integrate into your family, it's best to choose one of the
                            opposite sex to the resident dog. Two same-sex dogs are less likely to get along as adults,
                            especially if they're not neutered/spayed.
                            <br>
                            Also consider size and temperament, an older dog with a high prey drive may not be the best
                            match for a puppy from a tiny, fast-moving breed such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
                            <br>
                            Make the initial introductions under supervision, and expect some hesitation on the part of
                            either pooch.
                            <br>
                            Always remember to show lots of affection to your older dog.
                            <br>
                            It's sometimes difficult to tear yourself away from an adorable new puppy, but make a point
                            of greeting, feeding and petting the older dog first, as it reinforces his status (in both
                            his eyes, and the eyes of the new puppy) and helps to maintain a natural transition into the
                            'pecking order'.

                            My Dog Barks & Destroys Stuff When I'm Out - What Do I Do?
                            Does your puppy or dog drive the neighbors crazy with his barking and howling? Does he try
                            to remodel your home (maybe by chewing holes in the walls/door, or destroying carpets and
                            furniture) while you're out?
                            <br>
                            If so, chances are he's suffering from separation anxiety. There are levels of separation
                            anxiety, ranging from mild distress to hysteria (on the part of the dog, not you. Although
                            the sight of your Persian rug in tatters has the potential to trigger a hysterical
                            reaction!).
                            <br>
                            Puppies can be scared for a number of reasons, or experience separation anxiety.
                            <br>
                            There are all sorts of treatments for this problem, depending on the level of anxiety,
                            what's triggering it and how old he is.
                            <br>
                            Everything from simple herbal products, calming CD's, or behavior modification training can
                            work.
                            <br>
                            By using one, or a combination of treatments, you should be able to lower your dogs' anxiety
                            levels and teach him that it's okay to be left alone for a while, and that you always
                            return.

                        <p id="answer17">
                            Constant licking and/or scratching and red, itchy skin or hair loss are all signs of dog
                            allergies.
                            <br>
                            I think it's important to point out in this Puppy FAQs page that dogs suffer from allergies
                            just as people do!
                            <br>
                            There are many different causes and triggers for dog allergies, but most result in skin
                            problems and a variety of allergies
                            <br>
                            These include:
                            <br>
                            Flea allergy <br>
                            Inhalant allergy <br>
                            Dog food allergy <br>
                            Contact allergy <br>
                            There are many, many different ways to treat allergies in dogs, and of course the treatment
                            depends on the trigger!

                            How old should my puppy be when I bring him home?</button>
                        <p id="answer18">
                            It's critically important to realize that puppies need to stay with their mother and
                            littermates through 7 weeks old, at minimum. The 5-7 week period is so vital, being when
                            puppies learn social lessons on how to control the intensity of their bite (through play
                            with littermates), how to accept discipline and respond to it properly, and how to correctly
                            interpret canine body language.
                            <br>
                            Pups placed in homes before going through this stage tend to play-bite harder, and continue
                            the behavior further into adolescence, than pups who remain with the litter through 7 weeks
                            old. And, of course, a lack of understanding canine body language can lead to a host of
                            problems - inability to play properly, fear, over-excitement, or even aggression toward
                            other dogs.
                            <br>
                            A further consideration is that 7 weeks is the age when most experienced breeders and animal
                            professionals believe that puppy aptitude and temperament testing is the most reliable. So,
                            if your breeder is doing one of these tests to help determine which puppy will be best for
                            you, placement would be at or after 7 weeks old.
                            That said, oftentimes pups will do better going home somewhat later than 7 weeks old,
                            provided the breeder is equipped to train and socialize the litter. With my own breed, I
                            find 9 weeks to be a good age, in that the pups are generally emotionally ready and eager to
                            make the transition and to bond to new owners. Some of the smaller breeds can take longer to
                            mature physically, and may adjust more easily - and housetrain more readily - when they are
                            placed at 10 or even 12 weeks of age.
                            <br>
                            Whatever the age, it's important to stress that, if the breeder keeps the pups past 7 weeks
                            old, he or she must be committed to taking the time to regularly and thoughtfully introduce
                            each pup individually to new sights, sounds, surfaces, people, animals, and places.

                        <p id="answer19">
                            Your pup should be given some time to relieve himself outside first, before bringing him
                            inside. If he's too distracted and doesn't go, take him inside, but carry him, or only set
                            him down for brief periods, then take him back outside. It's important that any elimination
                            gets done in what is to be his regular potty area, or at the very least outside, that first
                            time.
                            <br>
                            Once your pup has relieved himself, feel free to allow him to explore a bit - carefully
                            supervised, of course! He doesn't need to see the whole house, but an exploration of the
                            main living areas will help him orient and adjust. It's fine, then, to offer a drink of
                            water, but hold off on giving any food. Your pup will most likely need a nap after all the
                            excitement, and very likely his stomach won't be ready for food until after that.

                            How Can I Help My Constipated Puppy?</button>
                        <p id="answer14">
                            Puppies can get constipated from time to time, and often it's the small/tiny breeds that
                            have trouble.
                            <br>
                            There are many reasons why a puppy can get constipated, and these from medical conditions to
                            hairballs (and everything in between!).
                            <br>
                            There are a few simple things you can do to treat the problem, and to prevent it happening
                            again. A correct diet, plenty of fluids and a good amount of exercise are all vital to a
                            healthy digestive system.

                        <p id="answer22">
                            Hold a treat in front of your dog's nose, and then raise it over his head. As his nose comes
                            up, his head should come down. Say "Sit!" Reward him when his hindquarters touch the ground.
                            Repeat the drill and gradually remove the food used during the lesson. (But always give him
                            a treat afterward if he's followed your rules.) After he learns the command, tell him to
                            "Sit!" each time he greets someone.

                        <p id="answer23">
                            Small-breed pups develop much faster than other breeds of dogs. They have faster metabolic
                            rates and need higher levels of protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus. Meanwhile,
                            large-breed dogs aren't considered full grown until they're nearly 2 years old. And while
                            many people think that large breeds should eat huge quantities of food, they simply need
                            meals that pack a nutritional punch. (If overfed, these animals risk putting on too much
                            weight too quickly and could develop skeletal problems.) The scientists at EUKANUBA™ have
                            developed specific formulas for every size puppy so you'll be sure to know they've got all
                            the nutrition they need to grow up healthy.

                            How soon does my new puppy need to see a vet?</button>
                        <p id="answer24">
                            As soon as possible. Many breeders and adoption agencies will have something like a 48-hour
                            guarantee, so you want to get it done in that time. But even without that, you still should
                            get the puppy in within a day or two. That way, if there’s something wrong, we can catch it
                            early and get it before it becomes a big problem.
                            <br>
                            It also gives us a chance to talk with owners about what it takes to raise a puppy. We need
                            to talk about worms, feeding, vaccinations, the financial aspect of owning a pet, and
                            everything else they can expect over the life of their dog.
                            <br>
                            The owners should bring in their list of questions, too. You need to ask your vet every
                            question that comes to mind. You can’t ask too many questions. Your veterinarian should be
                            willing to block out time for that.

                            Do I need to puppy proof my house? If so, how do I do it?</button>
                        <p id="answer25">
                            Puppies are like children. They love to learn and they’re inquisitive. And just like with
                            children, you have to keep things they can chew on and swallow out of reach. So keep toys
                            away, and don’t leave food where they can get to it, especially candy or foods that could
                            make them sick. Keep trash cans secured or they will get into them and eat bones and beer
                            bottle tops and other things that are dangerous. I can’t tell you how many beer bottle tops
                            I’ve taken out of puppies’ bellies.
                            <br>
                            The biggest thing we see in our emergency room with puppies is that they’ve swallowed
                            something. They swallow balls, a sock, a piece of a plastic toy. Puppies love to chew on
                            plastic.
